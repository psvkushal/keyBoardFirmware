keymap -> [./corneKeyboardLayerV1.excalidraw]

issues I have with this keymap
Mainly the issues is that it feels like left hand wrist more effort is being needed
- my right thumb is what I got habituated for using space, trying to get left thumb to use space is making my left wrist to hurt
- Having home row mods activated by opposite thumb is not intutive, one more pain point
- for some reason one shot mods donot activate, need to add oled display on the left side

Plans for the next keymap
- interchange space and enter (if possible create a key which can interchange the function between space and enter)
- activate one shot mods with the thumb on the same side
- add oled display to show the status of the oneshot mods
